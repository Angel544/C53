<marquee> Information about React Native </marquee>
<p>
    <ol>  
 <li>Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
            realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.
 </li>
<li>They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
 framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.</li>
 <li>JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
    the different components we want in the application.</li>
    <li>We wrote JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'snack'.
        'Snack' is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
        Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
        Snack.
